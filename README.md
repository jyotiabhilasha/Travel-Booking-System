SG-202: Mumbai to Bangalore, SpiceJet, $150

Hotels
Taj Hotel: Mumbai, 5 stars, $100/night

Ibis Hotel: Delhi, 3 stars, $50/night

Grand Plaza: Bangalore, 4 stars, $80/night

Car Rentals
Toyota Innova: SUV, $40/day

Mercedes E-Class: Luxury, $80/day

Honda City: Sedan, $30/day

# 🔍 Code Explanation
Interface Implementation
The project demonstrates proper use of interfaces:

java
// Example of interface implementation
class Flight extends TravelEntity implements Bookable, Displayable {
    // Implements all abstract methods from both interfaces
    public void book() { /* implementation */ }
    public String[] getDisplayData() { /* implementation */ }
}
GUI Components
JTable: Displays travel options in tabular format

JTextField: Search functionality

JComboBox: Filter options

JButton: Action triggers

JOptionPane: Confirmation dialogs and messages

Design Patterns
Strategy Pattern: Through Bookable interface for different booking behaviors

Template Method: In TravelEntity abstract class

Observer Pattern: Table updates when data changes

# 🛠️ Development
Adding New Travel Types
To add a new travel type (e.g., Bus):

Create a new class extending TravelEntity

Implement both Bookable and Displayable interfaces

Add to BookingManager in initializeSampleData()

java
class Bus extends TravelEntity implements Bookable, Displayable {
    // Implement required methods
    // Add bus-specific properties
}
Modifying Pricing Logic
Override the calculatePrice() method in specific classes:

java
@Override
public double calculatePrice() {
    // Custom pricing logic
    return basePrice * seasonalMultiplier + fees;
}
# 🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Class not found" error

Ensure the file is named TravelBookingSystem.java

Check that the class is in the correct package structure

GUI not displaying properly

Verify Java version compatibility

Check system look and feel support

Compilation errors

Ensure all imports are correct

Verify JDK installation

Debugging Tips
Use IntelliJ's built-in debugger

Check console for error messages

Verify all interface methods are implemented

# 📈 Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the system:

Database integration for persistent storage

User authentication and profiles

Payment gateway integration

Email confirmation system

Advanced search with date ranges

Booking history and receipts

Multi-language support

Export booking data
